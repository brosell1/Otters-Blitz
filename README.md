# Otters-Blitz
### Team Sleazy Otter's adapted version of the tabletop game Ghost Blitz - made for a 24 hour hackathon.

* Otters Blitz is a game of quick reflexes. Five objects are required to play: a red car, a black ball, a yellow dragon, a pink pig, and a white skull.

* When the button is pressed, two items will appear on the screen. The aim of the game is to grab the item that appears or, if no valid combination of items and colours is present, the item that is not represented.

* For instance, if a red car and a black dragon appears, the correct choice is the red car.

* However, if a yellow car and a white pig appears, the correct choice is the black ball.

* Play until a winner is decided or until you get bored.

* Please note that the game does not actually feature any otters. This was because nobody on the team could find a toy otter.
